# My Visual Basic Projects
Only selected ones, in alphabetical order.

## How to
To run a project `Example`, run the executable: `Example/Example/bin/debug/Example.exe`, unless stated otherwise.

## Note
There's a chance some Microsoft-related software needs to be downloaded, for the programs to run.
Please update me if you know if this is the case or not.

## Disclaimer
Most projects are discontinued, few are buggy.

## 01 AlmostExactly
Made with VB.NET on Visual Studio 2012, March 2012.

### Description
This is the game [Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows), with additional difficulties and modes.
In this version of the game, the words Almost and Exactly are used instead of Cows and Bulls, respectively.

## 02 Clipboard to Notepad
Made with VB.NET on Visual Studio 2012, June 2013.

### Description
Upon program startup, the clipboard text content is loaded inside a text box. Another text box is ready to be filled with the name of a text file, in which the clipboard content is to be stored. File save location is the desktop, by default.

## 03 CoralClock
Made with VB.NET on Visual Studio 2012, October 2012.

### Description
A top-most small window showing the clock, or a resettable stopper.
There's an option for alarm, but this was discontinued.

## 04 DeStoor
Made with VB.NET on Visual Studio 2012, September 2012.

### Description
Finds the roots of the quadratic formula whose coefficients are given as an input to the program, and shows the steps while doing so.

## 05 Extensionizer
Made with VB.NET on Visual Studio 2012, September 2014.

### Description
Drag and drop files, specify an extension, and all these files will change their extension to the one written.
I used this personally for years, until I decided to always keep the extensions visible.

## 06 Falling Stones
Made with VB.NET on Visual Studio 2012, August 2012.

### Description
A discontinued game. Uploaded here because of the design that I found pretty. Press P to pause and show the menu mid-game.

## 07 Files2TextList
Made with VB.NET on Visual Studio 2012, June 2012.

### Description
Drag and drop files (or browse), optionally specify a prefix or a suffix to add to the names, then one click generates a text file of the names of all of these files. Used personally to track what songs were newly added to my over-10GB directory of downloaded songs, by saving a snapshot of all files every few months.
